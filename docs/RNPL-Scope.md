# RNPL-Scope

Let's start from the basics:

## 1. Signup & Login

Users will signup with their work email, Name, mobile number (for OTP and future use), designation, department, profile picture.

## 2. Login & Password Recovery

Existing users will login using either email and password, or mobile number and OTP. If they forget their password, they will be able to recover by verifying either email or mobile number.

## 3. Admin Review & Role Assignment

Admins will review new signups, assign roles (Write/creator, reviewer, approver). But there will also be option to set permissions based on designation which will be deep inside to prevent mistakes. Admins can also invite users to sign up using their work email or phone number.

## 4. Main Dashboard

Where users will see everything at a glance that has anything to do with them. The navbar will be dynamic, based on roles. For the user with highest authority/access, will have the navbar with following items:

- Logo
- Dashboard
- Pending Files
- My Files
- All Files
- Notifications (Bell icon only)
- Avatar (Nested items to be displayed in avatar popover: Profile, Account, Admin Panel, Logout)

*Note: Remaining items will be added later.*
